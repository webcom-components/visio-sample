The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n\t * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n\t * Provide an options object to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on\n\t * the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n\t * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent calls\n\t * to the debounced function return the result of the last `func` invocation.\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is invoked\n\t * on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function is\n\t * invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n\t *\n\t * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n\t * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n\t *\n\t * @static\n\t * @memberOf _\n\t * @since 0.1.0\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n\t * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n\t * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n\t *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n\t * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n\t *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n\t *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n\t * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n\t * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n\t *\n\t * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n\t * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n\t *   'leading': true,\n\t *   'trailing': false\n\t * }));\n\t *\n\t * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n\t * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n\t * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n\t * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n\t *\n\t * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n\t * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n\t */\n\tfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n\t  var lastArgs,\n\t      lastThis,\n\t      maxWait,\n\t      result,\n\t      timerId,\n\t      lastCallTime,\n\t      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n\t      leading = false,\n\t      maxing = false,\n\t      trailing = true;\n\t\n\t  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n\t    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n\t  }\n\t  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n\t  if (isObject(options)) {\n\t    leading = !!options.leading;\n\t    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n\t    maxWait = maxing ?
